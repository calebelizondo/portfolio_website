## Technologies Used
Typescript, React, and Bootstrap

## My Experience and Thoughts
The project uses typescript and react to build a responsive interface. While I have worked with react in the past, integrating typescript into a react project was a lot of fun! It felt a lot cleaner and organized to code right out of the box and loved the type safety. Now that I tried typescript, I honestly can't imagine working without it. 

I also got a little more experience using some of the supporting libraries available to react developers. In this project I used React-Spring to make a very subtle parrellax effect on my landing page that I am quite happy with it.
